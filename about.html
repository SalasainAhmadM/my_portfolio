<p><font color="#ffffff">ï»¿Hi, my name is Aljohn Ebol, and I am a student at Western Mindanao State University taking up Bachelor of Science In Information Technology. I grew up having a loving and caring family, My family has always been there to motivate and encourage me to overcome all difficulties in life and achieve success. The role of every member in my family is unique and important in their own way. I thank God that I have grown up in a family full of love and discipline. My family values will definitely help me in becoming a better person. I love travelling, I love meeting new people and communicating with them. Through those experiences I have learned to interact with a diverse group of people, which has increased my ability to relate to others. I have also had the opportunity to meet new people and communicate with them.&nbsp;</font><br></p>
